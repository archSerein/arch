1. implement connection pool(I have tested with 300 threads and also you can watch what is going on in tomcat console)
2.implement genericDao(using java reflection, invocation handler)
3.data is copyed from hw2.amixyue.dao package and is for the homework use. All have main method as test. (I don't have time for junit, maybe next time)
4. For ur convenience, I also add hw2.amixyue package which is all the sources.
